# ThinkBoard

## What is this?
This is a desktop app for drawing connected components (like UML graphs).

## What's the big deal?
Well, if you have a sophisticated project and you can't get your head around all the parts it requires or have problems with
visualising stuff and how it's connected, you should draw it.

Yes, I hear you. Why would I need this when I have pencil and paper?
Well, it may be easier to draw it all on paper, but any changes in the project might be difficult and messy to rewrite.

## What's it like?
It's node based graph drawing so you can create, move, edit, connect and disconnect nodes.

## Want to contribute?
If you like this project you're welcome to contribute with code or suggestions.<br>The project was created in Eclipse (Mars).
